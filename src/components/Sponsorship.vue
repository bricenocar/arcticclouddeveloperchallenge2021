          <p>
            ACDC is the Nordic region's coolest hackathon with the best
            consultants. We gather once a year to show the world what we can do
            while learning from each other. The teams gather at the venerable
            Voksen√•sen hotel for 3 days. Even though we compete against each
            other, the most important moment is the knowledge we share.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although ACDC is the most epic hackathon on earth, we depend on help
            to get the wheels running. We are a non-profit event where everyone
            works voluntarily to get this done.
          </p>

            This year we have changed the sponsorship packages so that it is
            clear what you as a company sponsor. For each of the events that are
            sponsored, it will be possible to present merch that promotes the
            company.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can now sponsor in 3 different categories and choose which event
            you want to sponsor.
