                  Ida is a Data and AI Solution Architect in Avanade, and a Data
                  Platform MVP. Her passion is to help industries and people to
                  become more data driven and data literate. One of her favorite
                  platforms that she very often talks about on international
                  conferences, and a very important part of that passion or
                  mission of hers, is Power BI. She has been part of some cool
                  large international implementations and rollouts over the
                  years, both from a strategic and technical perspective. She is
                  also board member of local user groups like MDPUG Norway, and
                  PPUG. While she is missing her community in person events
                  these days, she are very much looking forward to meet you all
                  virtually in her first ACDC.
