        <h4 class="yellowtitle">Judging</h4>
        <p>
          Every judge can hand out a maximum of 60 points to each team at every
          jury duty each day. It means: 5 juries * 6 categories * 10 points * 3
          days = 900 max pr. team
        </p>
        <p>
          This year badges are back. Each team can get upto 33 badges. Each
          badge gives 10 points, but there is 1 badge that removes 10 points and
          1 special badge that adds 25 point for the team that gets it. It means
          that there are 325 extra points available.
        </p>
        <!-- <p>Each day the team that get the most points for each category gets a Teams background to be used until next evaulation.</p>
            <p>The Teams background can be lost to another team the next day if they get more points in the category than the current category leaders.</p>-->
        <p>
          At Final Jury Delivery each judge has 100 points each to hand out to
          the team they feel deserves it the most. There are 500 additional
          points.
        </p>

        <!-- <p>The maximum amount of achiveable points before the 100 wildcard points the last day will then be a total of: 6 categories * 10 points * X(Amount of judges) * 3 days of hacking + 300 points for badges.</p>
            <p>Example of maximum points for a team before wildcard points: 6 categories * 10 points * 6 judges * 3 days of hacking  + 300 points for badges =  1380 points</p>
            <p>Example of maximum points for a team after wildcard points: 6 categories * 10 points * 6 judges * 3 days of hacking + 300 points for badges + 600 wildcard points =  1980 points</p>  -->

        <h4 class="yellowtitle">The Grand Finale</h4>
        <p>
          The last day of the hackaton each team has to deliver a short written
          presentation of the solution they have created as a blog post.
        </p>
        <p>
          The judges now has to make the final decisions of wich teams that
          deserves to get the wildcard points.
        </p>
        <p>
          The judges will present top 3 teams, and finally announce the winner
          of ACDC 2021
        </p>
        <h4 class="yellowtitle">
          The winning team gets to take home the antlers and also gets to
          inscribe their company name at the very honorable winning teams plate
          placed on the antlers.
        </h4>
        <p>
          The winning team then gets to keep the antlers for 1 year until the
          next ACDC event.
